COMPANY DESCRIPTION

SAP is the global market leader for business software and thus contributes a considerable part of the world's economic power grid. At SAP you get your chance to put your ideas into action with maximum impact.The SAP Innovation Center Network is a strategic innovation entity within SAP, combining software engineering excellence with thought leadership and entrepreneurial spirit. Across various focus clusters and by building on strong teams, we pioneer game-changing solutions in close collaboration with startups, customers & partners in industry and research as well as with other SAP units. To ensure a successful go-to-market, we follow an end-to-end responsibility approach. By exploring unconventional ideas and developing inspiring proofs of concept, we push the state-of-the-art in computer science and its applied fields to provide SAP with foresight into future trends. As a Senior Developer / Development Expert for machine learning you will work in a team of experienced researchers and datax scientists taking on challenges posed by the SAP customers and product units. You will have the chance to work with the richest datax sets available in the world addressing real-world problems. Your primary goal will be to implement state of the art algorithms and to develop new approaches and technologies for deriving value from our customers' datax. You will have a chance to select and implement the best technologies and approaches based on your own experience, judgement, and experimentation results. This role combines (1) experience with machine learning (2) practical knowledge of working with scalable platforms for processing of huge datax sets, and (3) ability to understand the datax, associated processes and business implications, (4) scaling from minimum viable product up to shippable production code, (5) build and maintaining innovative new products from the ground-up.

EXPECTATIONS AND TASKS

You will work together with a team of dedicated experts including researchers, developers, dev ops engineers, and architects with a single goal of building best machine learning pipelines for a variety of use cases spanning commerce, financial markets, and procurement. You will work against fixed timelines and your success will be measured by the ability to deliver solutions matching the performance of top notch research prototypes. Your tasks include:
- Push the frontiers of what is possible in the area of machine learning so as to create new incubation
- Explore, understand, and implement most recent algorithms and approaches for supervised and unsupervised machine learning
- Comfortably handle multi-terabyte datax sets in scale-up and scale-out environments
- Understand business processes which create and consume datax so as to be able to select best approaches, evaluate their performance, and assess business relevance
- Create excellence both in terms of results quality and system scalability through continuous evaluation, analysis, and refinement of the system implementation
- Communicate the relevance of implemented systems and achieved results in a visual and consistent way

WORK EXPERIENCE

At least 5 years of experience in deep learning / machine learning / datax science development projects with a focus on innovation. At least 3 years of hands-on experience in building machine learning-based products.

EDUCATION AND QUALIFICATION / SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES

You are a self-starter, goal-oriented, striving for perfection engineer. As an ideal candidate you will demonstrate a proven track record in development of large-scale deep learning pipelines and combine it with curiosity for exploring of new use case and applications of machine learning to domains spanning processing of video, structured, and other unstructured datax. Ideally you bring breadth across all verticals (image, text, structured / time series datax) with a depth in one of them. Required
- Master degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Operations Research or related field
- Track record of developing novel learning algorithms and/or systems
- Proficiency in handling of multi-terabyte datasets in distributed Linux/Unix environments
- Experience with Machine / Deep Learning software packages such as Caffe/Torch/Theano/TensorFlow
- Ability to visualize datax and present core insights in a clear and compelling way
- Strong desire to overcome obstacles and make your work benefit SAP's customers
- Excellent English language skills Preferred
- Publication track record on deep learning / machine learning
- PhD degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Operations Research or related fieldPossible locations: Berlin, Potsdam, Walldorf.
